Copy the userscript into tampermonkey using the add script editor.

It will add 3 buttons below each post. The buttons are not very visible they look like little dots at the moment. Feel free to improve on them.

The buttons in order are Mute, Block, Not Interested. They correspond to the menu items for that post in the more menu. Pressing the button will open the more menu and 
enter that directive for you, this includes waiting for the block dialogs to pop up and pressing them so the process goes in 1 click.

Use in combination with the Tampernonkey browser extension. https://www.tampermonkey.net/ (Its a really useful tool for a huge amount of things anyway)
